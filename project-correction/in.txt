Introduction to Data Structures

Data structurs are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, serving as the backbone for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. They provide a way to handle data in a structured manner, enabling faster access, modification, and retrieval. Understanding data structures is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and solving complex computational problems. This article provides an overview of various data structures, their types, and their applications.

What Are Data Structures?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. It defines the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them. Data structures are designed to optimize specific tasks, such as searching, sorting, or traversing data. They can be classified into two broad categories: primitive and non-primitive data structures.
